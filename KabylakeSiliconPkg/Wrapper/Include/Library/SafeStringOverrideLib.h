/**
  Convert a Null-terminated Unicode string to a Null-terminated
  ASCII string.

  This function is similar to AsciiStrCpyS.

  This function converts the content of the Unicode string Source
  to the ASCII string Destination by copying the lower 8 bits of
  each Unicode character. The function terminates the ASCII string
  Destination by appending a Null-terminator character at the end.

  The caller is responsible to make sure Destination points to a buffer with size
  equal or greater than ((StrLen (Source) + 1) * sizeof (CHAR8)) in bytes.

  If any Unicode characters in Source contain non-zero value in
  the upper 8 bits, then ASSERT().

  If Source is not aligned on a 16-bit boundary, then ASSERT().
  If an error would be returned, then the function will also ASSERT().

  If an error is returned, then the Destination is unmodified.

  @param  Source        The pointer to a Null-terminated Unicode string.
  @param  Destination   The pointer to a Null-terminated ASCII string.
  @param  DestMax       The maximum number of Destination Ascii
                        char, including terminating null char.

  @retval RETURN_SUCCESS           String is converted.
  @retval RETURN_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  If DestMax is NOT greater than StrLen(Source).
  @retval RETURN_INVALID_PARAMETER If Destination is NULL.
                                   If Source is NULL.

                                    and DestMax is greater than
                                    PcdMaximumAsciiStringLength.

                                   If DestMax is 0.
