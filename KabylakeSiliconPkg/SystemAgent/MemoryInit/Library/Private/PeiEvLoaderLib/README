Warning:  This code MUST be removed once you are done using it for Electrical Validation Testing.
It should not be in the final BIOS as it can slow the boot time and leave the system in a vulnerable state.
DO NOT include this code in your final BIOS image.

To include this code into your BIOS image you will need to add to your compiler flags one to define SSA_FLAG as 1 (/DSSA_FLAG=1).
You will also need to add this module .inf to your project's .dsc and .fdf files.
If you are using the ClientRefCodePkgPei.dsc, you can add the following line close to the one used to build MemoryInit$(ECP).inf:

$(PLATFORM_SI_PACKAGE)/SystemAgent/MemoryInit/EvLoader/Pei/EvLoaderPeim$(ECP).inf

You will need to add a similar line in your .fdf file.

When including the EvLoader in your project you will need to insure that it is loaded and that it runs before the MRC does.

When running a target only test you will need to enable BDAT 4.0 support to retrieve test results.
